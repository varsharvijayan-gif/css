        <p>With the form they're in and what I saw recently against New Zealand, India are going to be extremely difficult to beat. A team will probably have to catch them on a bad night in a final to beat them," Klinger told PTI Videos in an interaction</p>
        <p> India's performance in the recent series against New Zealand showed why the defending champions would be extremely tough to beat in the T20 World Cup beginning on February 7, said former Australian cricketer turned coach Michael Klinger.</p>
